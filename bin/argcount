#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Count the number of arguments to this program, excluding argv[0]
# (in other words, argc - 1)
#
# This can be used with wildcards to quickly determine how many files there are
# matching a given wildcard pattern:
#
# Example:
#   argcount *.img
#   4
#
# The above example shows that there are four files ending with ".img"
